### ðŸ¤– AI Usage Report


AI played a critical role in accelerating and refining the development process for the ADmyBRAND AI Suite landing page and component system. From architectural planning to UI inspiration, I leveraged multiple AI tools to streamline both the creative and technical workflows.

ChatGPT was instrumental during the ideation and development phases. It helped structure the Next.js 14+ project using the App Router, generate reusable component templates (e.g., Button, Card, Modal, PricingCard, TestimonialCarousel), and optimize responsive design using Tailwind CSS. I used it to debug TypeScript issues, configure dynamic routing, and fine-tune Framer Motion animations for scroll-based interactions.

When designing for 2025 trends like glassmorphism and neumorphism, I used ChatGPT to translate modern Dribbble/Behance visuals into functional Tailwind utilities and component styles. AI also provided guidance on best practices for accessibility, SEO optimization, and image performance â€” ensuring the site remained high-performing and user-friendly.

For UI component prototyping, I explored v0.dev and GitHub Copilot to scaffold layout ideas and validate implementation patterns. These tools greatly reduced boilerplate and improved my velocity.

Finally, ChatGPT helped articulate the structure and copy for key landing sections such as Hero, Features, FAQs, and Pricing. It also generated real-world testimonials and pricing comparisons to simulate a fully working SaaS product.

Overall, AI significantly enhanced my productivity, creativity, and technical confidence, allowing me to focus more on visual storytelling and user experience while maintaining clean, scalable code.
